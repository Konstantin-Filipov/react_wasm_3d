# 3D Renderer
## Overview
A 3D renderer using WebGL.
The aim of the project comes from the initial idea of comparison between Java script and lower programming languages (C, C++, Rust etc.) in terms of 3D model rendering performance.
Therefore, you will see two separate implementations in this repository: Javascript and Web Assembly with Rust.
